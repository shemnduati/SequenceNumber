# SequenceNumber
Write a program that uses a loop to read integer values from the standard input stream
with the following specifcations.
• Does not prompt the user for input.
• Each non-zero value, x, is the frst number of a sequence of numbers generated by the
equations defned below.
• If the user enters a negative number, change it to a positive number.
• If the user enters a number greater than 65535, change the number to 65535.
• End the program if the user enters a 0 or if redirected input from a fle reaches the end
of the fle.
Calculating the sequence numbers:
The frst number in the sequence is identifed a a0, which will receive the integer collected by
std::cin. The next number in the sequence (a1) uses the rules below to determine which
formula should be used to fnd it’s value. If a0 is even, use a0/2. If the number is odd, use
3 ∗ a0 + 1 to calculate the next number.
an is the current number. an+1 is the next number in the series.
If we keep track of the number of times that a calculation was made and store that value
in the variable k, this particular series of numbers will eventually end up with one (1) as an
answer. That is an+1 = 1, which will be the fnal number in the series and also the stopping
condition of the loop. Thus, there exists an iteration value (k) such that an+1 = 1, which
can be rewritten as ak = 1
